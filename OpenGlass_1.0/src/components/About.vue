                Marlene and Carlos, two inspired individuals, discovered their passion for creating Latino-inspired drinks
                during gatherings with close friends and loved ones on special occasions. Their journey didn't start in a
                bar, but in the heartwarming moments of these gatherings. Amidst laughter and shared stories, they
                found joy in crafting drinks that celebrated their heritage and the lively Latino culture.
                <br><br>
                As a couple, their journey wasn't solely about mixing drinks; it was a love story with the art of mixology
                and a commitment to bringing people together. Marlene and Carlos put their hearts into every cocktail
                they created. For them, it was about establishing a place where each drink had a story to tell, and every
                sip was a journey into the rich world of Latin taste and authenticity. 
                <br><br>
                Together, they embarked on a shared mission to create "Open Glass," a mobile bar like no other. It's not
                just about serving drinks; it's about crafting unforgettable moments. They are dedicated to delivering
                top-notch quality, infusing a creative touch, and adding a hint of Latin flavors that connect you to the
                heart and soul of their culture.
